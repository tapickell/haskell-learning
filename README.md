## Haskell Learning

This is a place to put all my Haskell code from working through
tutorials and books.
This so far includes work from
* [Haskell in 5 steps](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_5_steps)
* [Haskell in 10 min](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learn_Haskell_in_10_minutes)
* [FP101x Introduction to Functional Programming](https://courses.edx.org/courses/DelftX/FP101x/)
* [Lean You Haskell for Greater Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)


> I am new to Haskell and have not seen anything giving good directory
structure to projects yet so I am using `src/` for writting Haskell
`*.hs` files,
`lib/` for `*.o` and `*.hi` files and then `bin/` for the compiled
binaries.
